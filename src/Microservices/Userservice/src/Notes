Oauth - an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
Oauth 2.0 - is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications,
desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.


client - a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.
Authentication server - a server that authenticates the user.
Resource server - a server that holds the protected resources.
Authorization server - a server that issues access tokens.
user-agent - the user's device used to interact with the authorization server.

Flow- client asks for permission from authorization server, the authorization server asks the user for permission, the user gives the authorization server permission,
then the authorization server sends the client an authorization code, the client sends the authorization code to the authorization server, the authorization server sends the client an access token,
 the client sends the access token to the resource server, the resource server sends the client the protected resources.


 Why not only token?
 Token is a string that represents an authorization granted by the resource owner to the client. The token specifies what actions the client can take and for how long.
